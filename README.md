# Optimizing-Cyber-Security-Techniques-for-Large-Infrastructures-using-Genetic-Algorithm


Welcome to the **Cyber-Security-Techniques-for-Large-Infrastructures-using-Genetic-Algorithm** project! This project explores the application of genetic algorithms to simulate and analyze various attack scenarios in cybersecurity systems.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project models complex attack patterns, simulating different types of security threats such as **DoS**, **DDoS**, and **SQL Injection**. Through the use of **Genetic Algorithms**, we evaluate system vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of defensive strategies.

## 🧰 Features

- **Attack Type Simulation:** Model various attacks to assess cybersecurity resilience.
- **Genetic Algorithm for Defense Strategy:** Use genetic algorithms for evolving attack and defense strategies.
- **Key Genetic Functions:** Implements crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation.
- **Visualization Tools:** Real-time plots of attack success rates and fitness evolution.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `AI_Project.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the simulation and analysis.
